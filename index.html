    <p>Hi, I'm Tim and I'm a fourth year student at Cal Poly majoring in computer science and minoring in communications. 
        I'm interested in the ways in which software can impact us and how we can better utilize software for our benefit. As software continues to integrate further into our lives, I hope to examine how software is successfully built by well-structured organizations and the effect these processes have on our everyday lives.
        Outside of software, I enjoy getting outside as much as possible whether it's going for a hike or playing basketball with some friends.
