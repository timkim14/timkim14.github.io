    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p style ="text-align:left;padding-left:400px;padding-right:400px;">
        Hi, I'm Tim and I'm a fourth year student at Cal Poly SLO majoring in computer science and minoring in communication. 
        I enjoy getting outside as much as possible whether it's going for a hike, playing basketball with some friends, or heading to the beach.
        I'm interested in the ways in which software can impact us and how we can better utilize software for our benefit. 
        As software continues to integrate further into our lives, I hope to examine how software is successfully built by well-structured organizations and the effect these processes have on our everyday lives.

    <h2>The Ripple Effects of Facebook</h2>
    <p style ="text-align:left;padding-left:400px;padding-right:400px;">
        For better or worse, Facebook has changed the way we view the internet and interact with others. As it has grown, more and more people have engaged with the platform in a variety of ways whether it is to run a business or catch up with old friends. As much as Facebook has been at the center of media attention, it offers a variety of services critical to the livelihood of many users. But Facebook isn’t just that social media platform that reminds you of your friend’s birthday. It’s a large tech company that maintains other important apps like Instagram and WhatsApp which are arguably just as important as Facebook. With services like Facebook groups, Facebook Marketplace, and Instagram Marketplace, users can successfully run a business and directly interact with customers through the platform. But with so many people relying on Facebook as a core component of their business, what happens when the service goes down? This past week, Facebook had all their services shut down including Instagram and WhatsApp for almost six hours and this downtime left ripples in many businesses and lives. I examine how this happened from a systems perspective and how disastrous situations like this can be avoided in the future through a thorough re-examination of current engineering processes.

    <p style ="text-align:left;padding-left:400px;padding-right:400px;">
        To understand how this happened, it’s important to examine how Facebook runs as a system similar to that of Ludwig von Bertalanffy. A central idea of the systems metaphor is the notion that organizations are complex organisms that must interact with their environment to survive. This couldn’t be more accurate of Facebook as a social media tech company. Facebook’s business only works because of the high daily usage and it is in Facebook’s best interest to make changes based on what user needs and feedback, something that Bertalanffy advocates for, also known as permeability. Facebook is a very large and complex organization with so many layers of decision-making and scope. The majority of employees exist at a certain hierarchal level within subsystems and supersystems which is described as a core component of the systems metaphor. But in a world of rigorous competition, the biggest component of large tech companies like Facebook is interdependence. This includes processes like reviews to make sure lines of code won’t break the system or not relying on other large tech companies for essential services like communication platforms.

    <p style ="text-align:left;padding-left:400px;padding-right:400px;">
    With this basic understanding of Facebook as a system, what exactly happened that caused such a big outage? As mentioned before, the big component here is the idea of interdependence. Facebook runs everything through services they have built internally. Many of the biggest tech companies you see today use Amazon for hosting services, but Facebook has built everything they need internally. The internet is really just a large network of computers talking to each other and is facilitated by two things, the Domain Name System (DNS) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The DNS keeps track of where Facebook is located in the large network of computers and BGP is the GPS system for getting to that location on the internet. So, when Facebook sent a bad update to a change in configuration to the routers that facilitate this network traffic, Facebook was wiped off the internet. This harmful update told the BGP that Facebook didn’t exist anymore, leading to no access to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp’s services for anyone. As the pandemic has accelerated the shift in work to a more hybrid approach, the company relies heavily on cybernetic communication, also known as virtual communication, one of Craig’s 7 domains of communication theory. But when Facebook’s existence on the internet went down, so did all their internal tools like an internal workplace communication platform similar to Slack. Not only did their services to the public go down, but the tools essential to resolving these issues were shut down. And if it couldn’t get any worse, their security systems that protected the hardware where the issues were being caused was locked because their internal system had gone down. This update in this configuration brought down one of the biggest tech companies for almost six hours and resulted in massive losses for both Facebook and those that rely on their essential services. When services at this scale go out, it brings up questions about the degree to which interdependence should exist in an organization. Should organizations be relying on each other to provide essential services in such a competitive world?
    </p>
    <p style ="text-align:left;padding-left:400px;padding-right:400px;">
        Facebook is, without a doubt, seen as a controversial company. But like many communication theorists have described organizations in general, Facebook is a very complex organization with a very challenging mission, aligning with the notion of requisite variety. At the scale it runs, a small mistake can ruin people’s lives. This situation hurt many businesses, but it can serve as an opportunity for Facebook and other organizations to re-examine their engineering processes. I can’t speak to how exactly the issue at Facebook occurred in terms of their processes, but software organizations at scale must continuously find ways to improve and create robust engineering practices especially when they rely on each other. I have no doubt that Facebook has thorough processes that are designed to avoid these scenarios, but this serves as a reminder of how quickly things can go wrong with software as it has no intuition of its own. This can often done be very effectively through reviews of when things go wrong and how organizations can prevent this from ever happening again. But it must be combined with a culture of humility and learning without finger pointing. Cultures that are eager to learn are quick to accept their mistakes ultimately succeed in software and is something that should be advocated for in all organizations. And if an organization decides to not rely on other organizations for services, it must examine all the worst possible scenarios with the interdependence they build and how they can be avoided. In the coming months, we are sure to hear more about what exactly happened at Facebook, but this is an opportunity for all software organizations to be reminded of the impact and power they have on our everyday lives.
