                Hi, my name is Tim Kim and I'm a recent graduate of Cal Poly SLO with a major in computer science and a minor in communciation.
                I grew up in Mill Valley, CA and am currently living in NYC working at Zocdoc as a software engineer. Some things that draw my interest:
                the intersection of human behavior/psychology and software, software for social good, and social networks. 
            </p>

                In my free time, I love to stay active whether its playing basketball or going for a hike.
                Some others things I enjoy are spending quality time with friends, playing the trumpet, and listening to all genres of music.
            </p>
